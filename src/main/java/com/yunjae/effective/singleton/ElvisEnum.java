/**
 * A third way to implement a singleton is to declare a single-element enum
 *
 * This approach is similar to the public field approach,
 * but it is more concise, provides the serialization machinery for free,
 * and provides an ironclad guarantee against multiple instantiation,
 * even in the face of sophisticated serialization or reflection attacks.
 * This approach may feel a bit unnatural, but a single-element enum type is often the best way to implement a singleton.
 * Note that you canâ€™t use this approach if your singleton must extend a superclass other than Enum (though you can declare an enum to implement interfaces).
